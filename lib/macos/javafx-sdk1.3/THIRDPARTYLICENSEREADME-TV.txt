LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

So what does this legalese mean? This is a modified version of the BSD license.
You may be more familiar with the Gnu Public License, since it gets a lot of
press. Well, forget about that. The BSD license is very different. While the Gnu
license puts all sorts of restrictions on what you can do with the software,
BSD-style licenses say "Hey, do what you like, we don't care. Just let people
know we wrote it, and don't sue us." That's really all there is to it. The first
paragraph with the numbered items says you can do what you like with the code,
as long as you keep our name on it. The original BSD license has a couple more
provisions there, we got rid of those. The second paragraph, all in capital
letters, is a standard legal boilerplate notification that tries to make it
difficult for anyone to successfully sue us over the software.

By the way, FreshMeat has a nice list of different types of freeware licenses.
There are quite a few besides BSD and GPL. There's also the OpenSource.org list
of open source licenses, which is not quite the same as the freeware licenses.

Here are some questions people ask about the license:

"Can I use your software in a freeware product?"
    Sure. 
"Can I use your software in a commercial product? Do I have to pay you?"
    Yes you can, and no you don't have to, although we certainly won't object to
any checks you care to send our way. 
"If I use your software as part of my product, do I have to include your source
code? Or my source code?""
    No. You're thinking of the Gnu license. Our license just says that if you
distribute our source code then you must leave in the license text; but you are
free to use it in binary-only form if you like, and put the license text in your
documentation instead. 
"Can I make my own version of your software?"
    Of course. 
"Can I distribute my own version of your software?"
    Yes, although we'd prefer that you didn't. Having multiple versions of the
same thing floating around is inherently distasteful. If you absolutely must
distribute your own modified version of our software, please name it something
else to avoid confusing people. 
"Would you please send me a signed disclaimer, so my company's lawyers are happy?"
    No. The license in the source code is sufficient. 
"We don't want to put your license in our documentation or distribute your
source, can we use your software anyway?"
    We occasionally grant special permission for this sort of thing. A donation
to ACME Labs will probably improve the chances.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if

(CRTs) to design, develop and test your programs, and copy and distribute the
object code form of your modified files under a new name.

·       Image Library.  You may copy and distribute images and animations in the Image
Library as described in the software documentation.  You may also modify that
content.  If you modify the content, it must be for use that is consistent with
the permitted use of the unmodified content.

·               Third Party Distribution.  You may permit distributors of your programs to
copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.

·       for any Distributable Code having a filename extension of .lib, distribute
only the results of running such Distributable Code through a linker with your
program;

·       distribute Distributable Code included in a setup program only as part of that
setup program without modification;

·               require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it
at least as much as this agreement;

·               display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and

·               indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including
attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.

iii.    Distribution Restrictions.  You may not

operating systems, run-time technologies or application platforms;

·               include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or

·               modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any
part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License.  An Excluded License is one
that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that

·       the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or

·       others have the right to modify it.

4.      INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.  Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the
software.  It may change or cancel them at any time.

a.      Consent for Internet-Based Services.  The software features described below
connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet.  In
some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect.  BY USING
THESE FEATURES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION.  Microsoft
does not use the information to identify or contact you.

Computer Information.  The following features use Internet protocols, which send
to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol
address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the
software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed
the software.  Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based
services available to you.

·       Windows Update Feature.  You may connect new hardware to the device where you
installed the software.  Your device may not have the drivers needed to
communicate with that hardware.  If so, the update feature of the software can
obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your device.  You can
switch off this update feature.

·       Web Content Features.  Features in the software can retrieve related content
from Microsoft and provide it to you.  To provide the content, these features
send to Microsoft the type of operating system, name and version of the software
you are using, type of browser and language code of the device where you
installed the software.  Examples of these features are clip art, templates,
online training, online assistance and Appshelp.  You may choose not to use
these web content features.

·       Real Simple Syndication ("RSS") Feed.  This software start page contains
updated content that is supplied by means of an RSS feed online from Microsoft.

b.      Misuse of Internet-based Services.  You may not use these services in any way
that could harm them or impair anyone else's use of them.  You may not use the
services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or
network by any means.

5.      PRODUCT KEYS.  The software requires a key to install or access it.  You are
responsible for the use of keys assigned to you.  You should not share the keys
with third parties.

6.      SQL SERVER BENCHMARK TESTING.  You must obtain Microsoft's prior written
approval to disclose to a third party the results of any benchmark test of the
SQL Server software that accompanies this software. 

7.      .NET FRAMEWORK SOFTWARE.  The software contains Microsoft .NET Framework
software.  This software is part of Windows.  The license terms for Windows
apply to your use of the .NET Framework software.

8.      MICROSOFT .NET FRAMEWORK BENCHMARK TESTING.  The software includes the .NET
Framework component of the Windows operating systems (".NET Component").  You
may conduct internal benchmark testing of the .NET Component.  You may disclose
the results of any benchmark test of the .NET Component, provided that you
comply with the following terms:  (1) you must disclose all the information
necessary for replication of the tests, including complete and accurate details
of your benchmark testing methodology,  the test scripts/cases, tuning
parameters applied, hardware and software platforms tested, the name and version
number of any third party testing tool used to conduct the testing, and complete
source code for the benchmark suite/harness that is developed by or for you and
used to test both the .NET Component and the competing implementation(s); (2)
you must disclose the date (s) that you conducted the benchmark tests, along
with specific version information for all Microsoft software products tested,
including the .NET Component; (3) your benchmark testing was performed using all
performance tuning and best practice guidance set forth in the product
documentation and/or on Microsoft's support web sites, and uses the latest
updates, patches and fixes available for the .NET Component and the relevant
Microsoft operating system; (4) it shall be sufficient if you make the
disclosures provided for above at a publicly available location such as a
website, so long as every public disclosure of the results of your benchmark
test expressly identifies the public site containing all required disclosures;
and (5) nothing in this provision shall be deemed to waive any other right that
you may have to conduct benchmark testing.  The foregoing obligations shall not
apply to your disclosure of the results of any customized benchmark test of the
.NET Component, whereby such disclosure is made under confidentiality in
conjunction with a bid request by a prospective customer, such customer's
application(s) are specifically tested and the results are only disclosed to
such specific customer.  Notwithstanding any other agreement you may have with
Microsoft, if you disclose such benchmark test results, Microsoft shall have the
right to disclose the results of benchmark tests it conducts of your products
that compete with the .NET Component, provided it complies with the same
conditions above.

9.      SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
gives you some rights to use the software.  Microsoft reserves all other rights.
 Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may

b.      Program Application and Driver Limitations.  You may not use or include any
of the Windows Mobile components located in the "\Program Files\Windows Mobile
5.0 SDK R2\" directory, nor any components thereof, in the development of any
program application, device or system in which a malfunction would result in a
foreseeable risk of personal injury, death or severe physical or environmental
damage.

11.     BACKUP COPY.  You may make one backup copy of the software.  You may use it
only to reinstall the software.

12.     DOCUMENTATION.  Any person that has valid access to your computer or

14.     ACADEMIC EDITION SOFTWARE.  You must be a "Qualified Educational User" to
use software marked as "Academic Edition" or "AE."   If you do not know whether
you are a Qualified Educational User, visit www.microsoft.com/education or
contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country.

15.     UPGRADE.  If this software is marked as an upgrade version, you may use it
only if you have a license to use the software eligible for upgrade.  If you
upgrade, this software takes the place of the earlier version, and this
agreement takes the place of the agreement for that earlier version.  You may
use the earlier version only as permitted in the Downgrade clause below.  

16.     DOWNGRADE.  You may install and use this version and an earlier version of
the software at the same time.  This agreement applies to your use of the
earlier version.  If the earlier version includes different components, any
terms for those components in the agreement that comes with the earlier version
apply to your use of them.  Microsoft is not obligated to supply earlier
versions to you.

17.     TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY.  The first user of the software may transfer it,
and this agreement, directly to a third party.  Before the transfer, that party
must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.
 The first user must uninstall the software before transferring it separately
from the device.  The first user may not retain any copies.

18.     EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to United States export laws
and regulations.  You must comply with all domestic and international export
laws and regulations that apply to the software.  These laws include
restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.  For additional
information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

19.     SUPPORT SERVICES.  Microsoft provides support services for the software as
described at www.support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx.

20.     ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement (including the warranty below), and the
terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services
that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

21.     APPLICABLE LAW.

a.      United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington
state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for
breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.  The laws of the state
where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer
protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

b.      Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other
country, the laws of that country apply.

22.     LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights.  You may have
other rights under the laws of your state or country.  You may also have rights
with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software.  This agreement
does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws
of your state or country do not permit it to do so.

23.     LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES.  YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND
ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE.
YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to

·       anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third
party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

·       claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition,
strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by
applicable law.
It also applies even if

·       repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you
for any losses; or

·       Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you.  They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages. 

**************************************************************************************

LIMITED WARRANTY

A.      LIMITED WARRANTY.  If you follow the instructions, the software will perform
substantially as described in the Microsoft materials that you receive in or
with the software.

B.      TERM OF WARRANTY; WARRANTY RECIPIENT; LENGTH OF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES.  THE

WHICHEVER IS LONGER.  If the first user transfers the software, the remainder of
the warranty will apply to the recipient.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS
LAST ONLY DURING THE TERM OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY.  Some states do not allow
limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so these limitations may not
apply to you.  They also might not apply to you because some countries may not
allow limitations on how long an implied warranty, guarantee or condition lasts.

C.      EXCLUSIONS FROM WARRANTY.  This warranty does not cover problems caused by
your acts (or failures to act), the acts of others, or events beyond Microsoft's
reasonable control.

MICROSOFT CANNOT REPAIR OR REPLACE THEM, IT WILL REFUND THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR
THEM, IF ANY.  YOU MUST UNINSTALL THE SOFTWARE AND RETURN ANY MEDIA AND OTHER
ASSOCIATED MATERIALS TO MICROSOFT WITH PROOF OF PURCHASE TO OBTAIN A REFUND. 
THESE ARE YOUR ONLY REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY.

E.      CONSUMER RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED.  YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER
YOUR LOCAL LAWS, WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE.

F.      WARRANTY PROCEDURES.  You need proof of purchase for warranty service.

MICROSOFT.  MICROSOFT GIVES NO OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR
CONDITIONS.  WHERE ALLOWED BY YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT.  If your local laws give you any implied warranties,
guarantees or conditions, despite this exclusion, your remedies are described in
the Remedy for Breach of Warranty clause above, to the extent permitted by your
local laws.

COPYRIGHT NOTICE & FAQ.

© 2008 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

The following is provided for informational purposes only and should not be
construed as legal advice. If you need legal advice, contact a lawyer.

What is copyright?

Copyright law protects original works, such as websites, books, music,
paintings, photos and video. A work is "original" if it contains some elements
you created and did not borrow from others. Typically, when you create an
original work, you own the copyright. As the copyright owner, you can control
how others use your work. For example, if you write a movie script, you have the
right to, and can prevent others from, copying your script, sharing it with
others ("distributing it"), making a movie or book from your script (a
"derivative work"), or publicly performing your script as a play or movie. You
also have the ability to sell or give away these rights. In other words, you
could sell the right to make a movie based on your script to a movie studio.

If you use someone else's copyrighted materials without permission, that use
generally violates the copyright owner's exclusive rights, and is copyright
infringement. So if you create a new work and include parts of other people's
works in it (such as an existing photo, lengthy quotes from a book or a loop
from a song), you must own or have permission to use the elements you borrow.
For example, if your script is based on an existing popular series, you should
obtain permission to use the elements you borrow from the series.

Copyright law is different from the law of personal property. If you buy a
physical object, such as a movie on DVD, you own the physical object. You do
not, however, obtain ownership of the "copyrights" (the rights to make copies,
distribute, make derivatives and publicly perform or display) in the content of
the movie. The fact that you have obtained physical possession of a DVD does not
automatically grant you the right to copy or share it.

If you make your own movie, it may include many copyrighted works in it. So, if
you decide to make a movie based on your script, you must either create all
elements of it on your own, or have permission to use the elements you borrow.
Especially keep in mind that photos or artwork hanging on the walls of your sets
and music on the soundtrack (even if you own the CD or MP3) may be copyrighted.
You should not include copyrighted works such as these in your movie without
authorization.

A few other things to keep in mind are:

   1. Just because a work does not include a copyright notice (e.g., © 2006
Microsoft Corporation) does not mean the work is in the public domain. Copyright
notices are generally not required for works to be protected by copyright.
   2. Just because a work is easily available on the internet or elsewhere does
not mean you may use the work freely. Look for terms of use, such as Creative
Commons, that explain how works you find on the Internet may be used.

Isn't it in the public domain?

Just because a work is freely available, does not mean it is in the "public
domain." Copyright is for a limited term; it does not last forever. In the
copyright context, "public domain" means the copyright term has expired. Once a
work is in the public domain, it may be freely used without permission from the
copyright owner.

Determining the term of copyright can be complex, particularly because copyright
laws vary from country to country. Also, even if the copyright on a work has
expired, you should be careful about how you use a public domain work. For
example, a book may be in the public domain, but it might not be ok to scan the
book cover to cover and post it on the internet. This is because the particular
version of the book may contain new copyrightable material that is not in the
public domain, such as cover art or footnotes.

What about fair use?

In limited situations, you can use copyrighted works without permission from the
copyright holder. It can be difficult to figure out whether use of copyrighted
works without permission is legal, though, because the laws in this area are
often vague and vary from country to country.

The copyright law in the United States has a doctrine called "fair use". Fair
use provides a defense to copyright infringement in some circumstances. For
example, fair use allows documentary filmmakers to use very short clips of
copyrighted movies, music and news footage without permission from the copyright
owner. Fair use is a difficult concept because determining whether something is
a fair use involves weighing four factors. Unfortunately, weighing the fair use
factors rarely results in a clear-cut answer.

Rather than applying a fair use test, many other countries have specific
exceptions to copyright infringement. The number and type of exceptions vary by
country, but they frequently allow copyrighted materials to be used without
permission from the copyright holder for activities such as nonprofit research,
teaching, news reporting, or private study.

If you incorrectly decide that something is a fair use or falls into an
exception to copyright infringement, you could be held criminally and civilly
liable and have to pay damages. We suggest you talk to a lawyer if you have
questions regarding fair uses of copyrighted works.

What happens if you upload copyrighted materials to one of our websites without
permission?

By law, we are required to take down videos, music, photographs or other content
you upload onto a website hosted by Microsoft if we learn that it infringes
someone else's copyright. If you believe that we have mistakenly taken down
content you uploaded that you own or have permission to upload, you can also let
us know that. Finally, if you upload infringing content repeatedly, we will
terminate your account and you could face criminal and civil penalties. So
please, respect other people's copyrights.

What if my stuff is on a Microsoft website without my permission?

If you believe that anything on a website hosted by Microsoft infringes your
copyright, let us know. Just provide us with the information requested here and
we will see that your copyrighted works are taken down.

What if I don't want my website crawled?

Microsoft search services (MSN Search and Windows Live Search) follow the Robots
Exclusion Standards. This means that you can control which pages Microsoft
search engines index and how often Microsoft bots access your website. To learn
how to do so, or for more information regarding Microsoft's webcrawling and site
indexing practices, please visit http://search.msn.com/docs/siteowner.aspx.

 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.    This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

 Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 with every copy.

 To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
 needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
 will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

 Brutally hacked by John Walker back from ANSI C to K&R (no
   prototypes) to maintain the tradition that Netfone will compile
   with Oracle's original "cc".

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    
    Copyright (C)   

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
    Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

that the Licensee will be liable for breach by any such entity. For the 
purposes
of this Agreement, the term
"employees" shall include independent contractors of Licensee, who have agreed
in writing to Licensee that they are
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and they retain no license rights or
other rights hereunder once they have
discontinued their performance of work on Licensee's behalf. Licensee, however,
will not be liable for the disclosure
of any Confidential Information which is:

confidentiality;
      c.   rightfully known to the Licensee without any limitation on use or
disclosure prior to its receipt from Intel;

THE USE
AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE BY LICENSEE, OEMs, DISTRIBUTORS, END
USERS, OR
ANY THIRD PARTY, AND ANY CLAIM OF PRODUCT LIABILITY, PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH
ASSOCIATED
WITH ANY UNINTENDED USE, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIM ALLEGES THAT AN INTEL PARTY WAS
NEGLIGENT
REGARDING THE DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE.

ELEMENTS
OF THE
BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN INTEL AND LICENSEE. INTEL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

shall be unenforceable or invalid under
any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such
unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this

provision shall be changed and interpreted
so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid
provision within the limits of applicable law or
applicable court decisions.
      10.11 Waiver. The failure of either party to require performance by the
other party of any provision hereof shall
not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter;

      5.2 Obligations of Receiving Party. Licensee will maintain the
confidentiality of the Confidential Information of

know and who agree to abide by nondisclosure terms at least as comprehensive as
those set forth herein; provided
that the Licensee will be liable for breach by any such entity. For the 
purposes
of this Agreement, the term
"employees" shall include independent contractors of Licensee, who have agreed
in writing to Licensee that they are
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and they retain no license rights or
other rights hereunder once they have
discontinued their performance of work on Licensee's behalf. Licensee, however,
will not be liable for the disclosure
of any Confidential Information which is:
      a.   rightfully in the public domain other than by a breach of a duty to
Intel;
      b.   rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of
confidentiality;
      c.   rightfully known to the Licensee without any limitation on use or
disclosure prior to its receipt from Intel;
      d.   independently developed by employees of Licensee; or
      e.   generally made available to third parties by Intel without
restriction on disclosure.

referenced therein, at any time without
notice, but is not obligated to support, update or provide training for the
Licensed Software. Intel may in its sole
10/09
discretion offer such services under separate terms at Intel's then-current
rates. Licensee may request additional

Licensee agrees to be solely responsible to
Licensee's OEMs, Distributors and End Users for any update or support 
obligation
or other liability which may arise
from the distribution of a Product.
8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
      8.1 IN NO EVENT SHALL INTEL OR THE INTEL PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
DAMAGES
WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, 
BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION, OR LOST INFORMATION) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO 
USE THE
LICENSED SOFTWARE, EVEN IF AN INTEL PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF
SUCH
DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR

NOT
APPLY TO LICENSEE. LICENSEE MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM
JURISDICTION

AND
EXPENSES, AND REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES ARISING OUT OF, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
THE USE
AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE BY LICENSEE, OEMs, DISTRIBUTORS, END
USERS, OR
ANY THIRD PARTY, AND ANY CLAIM OF PRODUCT LIABILITY, PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH
ASSOCIATED
WITH ANY UNINTENDED USE, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIM ALLEGES THAT AN INTEL PARTY WAS
NEGLIGENT
REGARDING THE DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE.
      8.3 THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL 
ELEMENTS
OF THE
BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN INTEL AND LICENSEE. INTEL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO
PROVIDE THE
SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.

otherwise, either voluntarily, by operation of law of otherwise, any portion of
this Agreement. Any attempt by
Licensee to assign or delegate any rights, duties or obligations set forth in
this Agreement without Intel's prior written
consent shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and shall be null
and void. Except as provided above,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall bind and inure to each party's
successors and assigns.

contained in Intel's standard
acknowledgment form that are in conflict with these terms, shall be of no force

parties.
      10.10 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement
shall be unenforceable or invalid under
any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such
unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this
Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such
provision shall be changed and interpreted
so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid
provision within the limits of applicable law or
applicable court decisions.
      10.11 Waiver. The failure of either party to require performance by the
other party of any provision hereof shall
not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter;
nor shall the waiver by either party of a
breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision
itself.
